        <h1>Walking Home, 1939</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace" style="font-size: 16px">A nervous child, her parents thought
she should be shielded from talk of war.
While her father listened to the six o’clock news
the door was locked. 
She pressed her ear to the keyhole,
was caught by her mother and punished.
    
Crazy parents. They never thought that at school
fire drill would become air raid practice,
that children would be taught what to do 
if the siren sounded when they were half way home.

In the playground, boys were spitfires, weaving, zooming.
They talked excitedly about bombs falling. 
Instead of tag one would be a siren, 
loud as he could and scary. At his screech
skipping and hopscotch stopped as
girls and boys rushed to the shelter door.

Always last, caught by the siren, and ‘out’
she learned to live in two worlds.

At half past three
a swarm of children rushed through the gate
pealed off in ones and twos as they reached their turnings
and disappeared behind their own doors. 
She lived another mile away, walked on alone.

The road was empty, silent
apart from a bike or bird.
A hum high in the distance got louder.
Was it a plane? She listened hard.
Even the crunch of her footsteps became harsh and alien.
The noise came nearer. 
Should she lie in a ditch? “Face down.” the teacher said.
Dirty her dress, make her Mum cross?

Slowly silence descended, like a familiar blanket. 
She got up, dusted herself down, hurried home.
At her gate she waited for her breath to settle,
stuck on her smile.

“Have you had a nice day at school, dear?”
“Yes, Mum”.</div>

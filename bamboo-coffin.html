        <h1>Bamboo Coffin</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace">First thought - a picnic hamper
then a Moses basket.
More like a coracle
robust enough for sailing home.

As I threaded raffia through its weave
to tie tomorrow’s flowers
I looked inside, saw the sturdy frame
and thought  ‘I’d feel safe in here’.

Everyone brought something to the church:
a rosebud, dahlia, tiny cyclamen
lemon balm and rosemary
conkers hung on strings, autumn leaves.

Soon all the ties were used. To thread some more
I pushed a long curved needle through the weft
just above his nose, his knees, his feet.
At the time it seemed quite natural.

Through the crowded nave the coffin went.
Conkers bumped like fenders.
My rose stood tall above the blaze of flowers.
A red leaf fell.

The congregation sang of faith and grief.
Committal prayers were said; the coffin launched.
Its ashes rest with his in a favourite wood;
its smoke has risen with him.</div>

        <p><i>Both of Averil's daughters suffered serious traumas in their mid / late teens. In both cases Averil realised how serious the injuries were, and had to insist on further investigation. She wrote this poem immediately after Elizabeth’s accident.</i></p>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace" style="font-size: 16px">The tide was out as two children played
Through a hot summer day by the sea,
Building their castles of sand and stones
Where later the water would be.

The sea crept in while they finished their work,
The waves as they came seemed to say
To one 'We will ruin the castle you've made.'
To the other they said 'Come and play.'

The first built a wall as high as he could
To keep his sand fortress from harm.
'Go back!' he yelled at the charging waves,
And he jumped from their surge in alarm.

The strong sea swept over rampart and wall
And flattened the work of his spade.
His castle was gone and he trudged slowly home,
Angry and sad and dismayed.
          
'It's coming' the other said. 'Quickly I'll dig
A gully to channel the sea
And a moat so the water can rush all around
And make it an island for me.'
          
He stood on his towers, not minding their fall
As the water came rippling round,
And when a great wave washed right over it all
He laughed as he leapt to dry ground.

The tide will come in for you and for me
As it did for the children that day.
Does it only destroy? Or dare we believe
It's a last invitation to play?</div>

        <h1>Fair Trade Song</h1>

        <pre>We have neighbours who are hungry
far away, far away.
All of us can help them
earn a better living
Buy Fair Trade. Buy today.
 
Low paid farmers grow bananas
far away, far away.
Fair trade pays them better
helps them have clean water.
Buy Fair Trade. Buy today.                  
 
Skilful women, weaving, sewing
far away, far away
need to sell their baskets
woolly hats and bracelets.
Buy Fair trade. Buy today.
 
Fair trade coffee picked and processed 
far away, far away
buys shoes to walk to school in,
loos to drop their poo in.
Buy Fair Trade, buy today.
 
Nuts and chocolate, sweets and biscuits
on display in shops today
provide an opportunity
to help a poor community.
Buy Fair Trade. Buy today.</pre>

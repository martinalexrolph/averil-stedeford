        <p>Averil Stedeford (nee Walker) was born in 1932 in Kingford, Essex. She had a difficult childhood, particularly the time when she was evacuated to the US to stay with an aunt she had never met.</p>

        <p>After leaving school she studied at University College Hospital, where she met Brian Stedeford. They
    got married in 1955. Averil then trained to be a GP. After practicing for a few years she became a
    psychiatrist, and then worked at the first NHS hospice to be set up. She published Facing Death,
    Patients, Professionals and their Families in 1984. The second edition was published in 1994 and
    includes several of her poems. This is out of print, but will is being produced as a pdf.</p>

        <p>Averil had a few poems published in her grammar school magazine. She began writing poetry again
    when in Oxford in the mid-1960s. She attended a three year extra Mural Studies course at Oxford
    University, and then started writing more seriously. Some of her poems were about her patients at
    the hospice.</p>

        <p>Soon after she left the hospice, her husband was found to have inoperable cancer. After she nursed
    him to the end, she then embarked on another project – buying a smaller house in Headington,
    Oxford and making it as green as possible. She was awarded the Observer Ethical Award for this in
    2006</p>

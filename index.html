        <p>Averil Stedeford (nee Walker) was born in 1932 in Kingford, Essex. She had a difficult childhood, particularly the time when she was evacuated to the US to stay with an aunt she had never met.</p>

        <p>After leaving school she studied at University College Hospital where she met Brian Stedeford, a physics graduate whom she met through the Student Christian Movement. They got married in 1955. Averil worked as a junior doctor in Medicine and Surgery in Fulham Hospital and then Paediatrics and Obstetrics in Manchester. She had two girls in 1958 and 1961, Chrissy and Elizabeth. She worked as a part-time GP and commenced training as a psychiatrist. She started a part-time post at <a href="/sobell-house.html">Sir Michael Sobell House</a>, the first hospice set up within the NHS. She published <i>Facing Death, Patients, Professionals and their Families</i> in 1984. The second edition was published in 1994 and includes several of her poems. This is out of print, but will is being produced as a pdf.</p>

        <p>Averil had a few poems published in her grammar school magazine. She began writing poetry again when in Oxford in the mid-1960s. She attended a three year extra Mural Studies course at Oxford University, and then started writing more seriously. Some of her poems were about her patients at the hospice.</p>

        <p>Both her daughters suffered serious traumas in their mid / late teens. In both cases Averil realised how serious the injuries were, and had to insist on further investigation. She wrote the poem <a href="/nottingham-five.html">Nottingham Five</a> immediately after Elizabeth’s accident.</p>

        <p>Soon after she left the hospice, her husband was found to have inoperable cancer. After she nursed him to the end, she then embarked on another project – buying a smaller house in Headington, Oxford and making it as green as possible. She was awarded the Observer Ethical Award for this in 2006</p>

        <p>After she had completed the house refurbishment she enjoyed working as a volunteer at the local Fairtrade shop. In 2012 she suffered a stroke. She did return to live in her own home, but in 2015 she moved to a care home in Hanley Swan to be near Elizabeth, who runs a B&B with her husband, <a href="https://www.thedellhouse.co.uk">The Dell House</a>. Her older daughter Chrissy was widowed in 2018 works as a carer in Beaconsfield.

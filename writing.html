        <h1>Writing</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace">Writing is amazing therapy.
Words on paper bring so much to light.
What I have written still surprises me.

Persistent ghosts from which I cannot flee, 
seeing their names in print, may take flight.
Writing is amazing therapy.

Words I put on paper secretly
are often angry, vicious, not polite.
What I have written still surprises me.

Vivid dreams, and fears that puzzle me
appear on paper in a different light.
Writing is amazing therapy.

Working quietly on my poetry
opens doors to tears and to delight.
What I have written still surprises me.

A pen gives sorrow words, sets pent guilt free,
so love can heal, can pardon the contrite.
Writing is a powerful therapy.
    
Our souls are like the stars we cannot see.
Writing clears the clouds, makes midnight bright.
Writing is amazing therapy.
What I have written still surprises me.</div>

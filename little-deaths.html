        <h1>Little Deaths</h1>

        <pre>Only a live tree sheds its leaves.
On branches that are dead they cling and wither,
Twig and leaf blow down and rot together,
No scars, no dormant buds.

Not for them the fiery autumn glow,
The flurried dance before the first light snow,
The little deaths that signal a tree&#39;s life
And later nourish it.</pre>

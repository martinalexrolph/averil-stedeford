        <h1>Nottingham Five</h1>

        <pre>
They knew you
from your driving licence.
No one else could tell
who any was
and only one could scream
in that crushed wreck.
    There were five,
    you are alive,
    but two are dead.

At half-past five
a doorbell in the dark:
Policeman.
Do you have a daughter?
Name Elizabeth?
We do.
The news is bad.
Go quickly, it is bad.
    There were five,
    she is alive
    but two are dead.

A rag-raid, round the pubs,
for charity.
Five in a mini
in the driving rain.
Head-on collision
with a heavy lorry.
Lucinda screamed and screamed
but no one came
and four were silent.
    There were five,
    three are alive
    but two are dead.

I rinse the blood and vomit
from your clothes.
Stripped off you,
I unroll them to reveal
more of the story.
Lumps of pizza,
bits of soggy crisp,
thirty-three p
falls into the sink.
How glad I am that
I can scrub your jeans,
not burn them.
    You are alive,
    but there were five,
    and two are dead.
        </pre>

        <p><i>Both of Averil's daughters suffered serious traumas in their mid / late teens. In both cases Averil realised how serious the injuries were, and had to insist on further investigation. She wrote this poem immediately after Elizabethâ€™s accident.</i></p>

        <h1>Let's Do It!</h1>

        <pre style="font-size: 16px">Winds are getting stronger, with tornados and tsunami.
The way the sea is rising and warming is alarming.
Climate change is threatening much of life on earth
so I have been investigating what it would be worth

doing to make a difference. Because I’ve lost my spouse
I thought it would be ethical to buy a smaller house.
I have chosen a semi so I’ll have some cash to spare
to make my new home very green and show the world I care.

My double glazing window frames are made of Swedish wood.
Plastic uses too much oil. Everybody should
use timber that’s sustainable. Firing bricks is cruel
to the environment, it burns up too much fuel.

I need a bigger kitchen so a timber built extension
will house my green appliances. It is my intention
to shrink my carbon footprint so I’ve chosen solar power
for heating underneath the floor, and water for the shower.

The fleece that lines the loft and walls is guaranteed to keep
me cool in summer, warm in winter, like a moorland sheep.
Underneath my garden is an underground tank
collecting rainfall from my roof, to store it, like a bank,
for washing clothes and watering, and to flush the loo.
This will halve my water use. Could you do it too?

Perhaps you think ‘OK for her; she’s a toff’
but even you could make a start by switching things off,
by using far less petrol, water, gas and oil.
The world is far too wonderful for us to spoil.</pre>

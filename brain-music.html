        <h1>Brain Music</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace">My brain
orchestrated for symmetry,
rhythm, alternation,
knows a member is stricken
recruits its partner for support.

My right hand knows
what my left hand cannot do.
They try together.
Slowly the left one learns
to drop things less often
to help with buttons
to pull my sweater off
to wash my right side
to aim my fork at my mouth
to hit the right keys.

Soon they will be a pair 
in harmony
I will be able to play tutti
my hands will duet 
and I will walk solo.</div>

        <p><i>In June this year I had a stroke. I have no specific knowledge of the processes of stroke recovery, but I had an intuitive feeling that my left hand (the damaged side) performed the exercises I was given better if the right hand did them at the same time. It was as if I was tapping into that deep part of the brain which is developing when a child in a high chair enjoys banging both hands down on the tray, that bit that makes us walk in time without deciding to when we here a march. So here is a poem about that experience.</i></p>

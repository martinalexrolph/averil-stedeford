        <h1>Lucky Girl</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace">Aren't you a lucky girl? 
Going on that big boat.
<i>Where to?</i>
America.
<i>Where's that?</i>
A long way across the sea.
<i>Who will look after me?</i>
Daddyâ€™s sister,
An auntie you have never seen.

<i>I don't want to go.</i>
You are a lucky girl.
<i><u>I don't want to go!</u></i>
If you cry like that
You won't have any tea.
I could not stop, was sent to bed
until I could be good.

As the tears subsided
I heard the chink of tea cups,
The sounds of eating.
I wiped my face, 
winced downstairs
into a gaze of condemnation,
Guilty, naughty, lucky girl.

The boat was full of lucky children.
I found the lounge and Cunard stationery.
<i>Dear Mum and Dad,
The boat is nice.
I'll be allrite.
Don't miss me.</i>

That boat crossed safely
but one in the convoy, bound for Canada
full of German prisoners, was torpedoed.
The next boatload of children was sunk.</div>

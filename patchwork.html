        <h1>Not Here</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace">Wartime blackout, scraps from family sewing  
even curtain fabrics found a place 
as patches to be joined by hand to make 
a spread of memories for our double bed. 

Progress was slow. I stowed it in the loft. 
Untouched for forty years, it gathered dust
but when unpacked, the colours were still bright. 
Already it would almost fit a single bed. 

I took it up again
stitching while I kept him company.
“Not until I’m gone!” he said, and laughed
hearing how I planned to finish it. 

Now I have the comfort of a coverlet
edged with patches from his favourite shirts
ties that tell his story
his nearly new pyjamas.</div>

        <p>This was written in 2007 after Averil finished the patchwork quilt that she first started in the 1960s.</p>

        <p>The first phase used fabric from backout curtains, summer dresses from Christine and Elizabeth, and her mum's dresses.</p>
        
        <p>The second phase included fabric from Elizabeth's maternity dungarees, bridesmaid's dresses, the Milham Ford School uniform and curtains from their home on Staunton Road where they lived from 1968 to 95</p>

        <p>The third and final phase used fabric from her husband Brian's clothes: his shirts, pyjamas, underpants(!) and, in the corners, four ties from the Institute of Physics, London University, the British Horological Society and the Antiquarian Horological Society.</p>

        <h1>Young Oak</h1>

        <pre>Young oak, potential tree
gashed by the hedgerâ€™s billhook
split and bent
lost your identity.

Had your acorn dropped
in a different spot
where the farmer thought
a shady oak should be

and ivy grew
to cling and threaten you
the selfsame blade
might have cut you free.</pre>

        <h1>Sunflower in October</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace">More solemn than a small child’s sulk
my sunflower hangs its head, heavy with seed.
Its leaves are withered, papery and grey.
It looks like grief.

I have watched its sunlit face upturned,
a whorled mosaic, geometric wonder.
From edge to centre, each green floret burst
rich with pollen and a drop of nectar
drawing bees to fill the comb for winter.

Now bedded in its drooping head is seed
enough to scatter over half a field
yield golden oil, nourish wintering birds
or flow from the baker’s hand to sprinkle bread
so does it matter that the rest is dead?</div>

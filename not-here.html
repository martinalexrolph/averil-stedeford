        <h1>Not Here</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace">My body, 
host to mind and soul for eighty years
became unserviceable.
It clung to me through frailty and pain,
till it could let me go.

Now it is buried in a high field
where wild flowers  bloom and rabbits run.
Around it and within, microbes divide and thrive. 
In my bones, tree rootlets worm their way
into the foramina, anchor themselves.
Above, the saplings take their time
to grow and mesh into a wood
which will offer peaceful shade 
when those who sang at my burial have gone.

In nearby fields, turbines turn.
panels soak up sunlight, 
This is a farm where
Nature lets her power be harvested.
This is earth life in all its vigour.  
My body offers itself to this place.
but I am not here.</div>

        <p><i>Averil wrote this poem specifically to be read at her funderal, which was at Westmill Woodland Burial Ground in April 2021. It was written to be used at a public service but COVID restrictions meant this could not happen.</i></p>

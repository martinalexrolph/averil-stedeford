        <h1>Ellipse</h1>

        <pre style="text-align: center">The doorbell
rings and flowers
are delivered. Visitors
arrive, creep in to see.
Any passer-by will know
if this is a coming or a going.

In the bedroom, centre of attention,
someone small and wrinkled lies awake.
Too young to smile. All she can do is take
her mother’s breast, cry, excrete and sleep.
She gives joy and hope to all who come,
delight in her new life, her innocence.

Bustling woman, seldom sitting down,
deceives herself that all she does is give
to other people. And all they do is take.
She can be so fraught she doesn't know
whether she’s coming or going.

In the bedroom, centre of attention
someone old and wrinkled lies awake,
smiling still but no strength left to speak.
Wearing nappies. Needing help to drink.
All she can do is take.
In return her eyes give out her love.
She watches with concern as others grieve
to lose her gifts, not knowing she will leave
memories, wisdom, and experience.

The ellipse of life has perfect symmetry
wide in the middle, ends
both gently narrowing
There’s mystery in
this similarity of
coming and
going.</pre>

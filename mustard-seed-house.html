        <h1>Mustard Seed House</h1>

        <pre>On Iona, a declaration:
The world belongs to God.
"That means your house," He said.
"I’ve got a job for you."
This was the mustard seed.
Hear how it grew.

Bereaved a year, I knew my present house
and garden were too big,
that I must sell and leave. He spoke again:
Make a home arranged for growing old
and make it green.

I bought a very ordinary house
the sort where many live
three bedroom semi.
Costing less, there would be spare money
to show how green such a house could be.

Widow, seventy three, not worldly wise.
How to begin such an enterprise?
Yellow pages. Look for architects.
One said the environment was his specialty.
We met and talked, pondered and agreed.

As work progressed, we got publicity.
Three times the film crews came,
BBC and ITV. Observed by the Observer
we got an Ethical Award, and on their film
delightful words of praise from Monty Don.

So much the workmen had to do was new.
‘Steep learning curve’ Jon the contractor said
each time mistakes were made,
He kept his head while problems were resolved.
Confusion sometimes reigned. It stressed me too
but now, when someone wants an eco-house
men from all the building trades
know what to do.

You must have a web-site, people said.
I had no clue. That, said folk from SAGE,
a Christian group, we can do.
A carpenter became photographer.
The Independent publicised its name
and it’s still being visited today.
If you use it too, you can join
those who come week by week to see
what has grown from that mustard seed.</pre>

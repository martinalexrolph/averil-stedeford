        <h1>Pennsylvania Mining Town, 1941</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace" style="font-size: 16px">That summer in a narrow stinking alley
where toilets leaked and flies edged oily puddles
children walking home could hear black men singing

plantation songs of cotton fields and heaven.
The kids shouted ‘Honey dippers!’, laughed, ran home
except for one eight year old, drawn to wait, alone.  

She watched long ladles swinging, slurry pouring
buzzing halos round the great black heads
and knew a scary kinship in the song. 
of far away places which were home.

Something deep drew her to their song, 
unafraid, she stopped and listened,
and lingered 
till the last deep notes were gone.</div>

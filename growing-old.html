        <h1>Growing Old</h1>

        <div class="preserve-whitespace">Because I can’t go far, I study what is near.
An early crocus, shut up against the cold
opens in an hour in water on my table
its petals bent right back,
astonishingly flat, a golden fan.
Its pistil stands up tall, calling for a bee,
pollen laden, which is sound asleep.

When I switch off the light, 
hope gone, it shuts as tight.
Wonderfully furled, it tucks itself right in 
and opens out again when  syrup streams
trembling, from the spoon onto my porridge. 

I watch a pair of collared doves
perched on the feeder roof.
They nod and peer and twist as they prepare
to turn around and fly,
squeezing in to shelter and to feast.
“Which one will venture first?” I ask
and laugh when I’m proved wrong.

Don’t complain, I tell myself
at every ache and pain.
Think each one’s an inkling 
that my shell is cracking
preparing for the moment of release.

Inside my soul is pecking
yearning to be free 
but each uneasy day’s 
a chance for it to grow
ensuring I’m more ready
for a rich eternity.</div>
